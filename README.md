I did what I was required to do:
1)I was able to add character into the project that games
     1a)All of the controls are working fine
2)I also added a weapon
3)I realized that the character does not have a shadow.
    3b)Is this becuase the character is just made up of collisions?
4)I tried making my character's gun via animation player, but I soon discovered its limitations.
